GPG Suite 2017.1b2
==================
Jan 20th, 2017


GPGMail 2.7b2
-------------

### macOS 10.12 Sierra support
* First public GPGMail beta for 10.12. [GPGMail #874]

Fixes
-----

* Incorrect error messages about invalid signatures fixed. Messages created using b1 will remain broken. New messages sent with GPGMail will work as expected. [#885]

Known Issues
------------
* If multiple private keys are available for the same email address, GPGMail currently picks one at random to sign the message. [#895]
* Some messages might not load correctly. If you can provide us with an example .eml file we'd love to debug the issue.
* If you cancel the pinentry request for signing upon sending a message it might lead to unexpected behavior.
* Inline PGP is currently not supported at all, PGP/MIME will be used instead. [#894]
* "BCC" recpients are currently not treated differently from "TO" or "CC" recipients (gnupg --hidden-recipients option not currently in use). [#896]
* Mail Act-On incompatibility: to use GPGMail you need to disable Mail Act-On, otherwise encrpytion will not be working. [GPGMail #888]
* Mail rules for signed or encrypted messages will not work for PGP/MIME signed/encryted messages.
* Keys that are imported using gnupg cli or GPG Keychain might require a restart of Mail in order to be picked up by GPGMail.


GPGPreferences 2.0.2b2
----------------------

### Improvements

* Crash reporting options can be editied. Help us fix crashes by enabling optional crash reporting. [#89]
* Comment editing option removed. We display a one time dialog for custom comments, to allow users to easily remove an existing custom comment when one was used. [#88]


MacGPG2 2.0.30b2
----------------

### Fixes

*  Pinentry languages on 10.12 fixed. Pinentry would use secondary system languages in rare occasions. [MacGPG #692]
